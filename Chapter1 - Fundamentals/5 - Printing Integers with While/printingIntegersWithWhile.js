    Line 1 declares the 'i' variable and assigns it a value of 2000.

    Line 2 sets up the 'while' loop and gives it the parameter. In this case it will run until i = 5280.

    Line 3 logs the current value of 'i'.

    Line 4 increments the value of 'i' by one, and then the while loop goes again.
